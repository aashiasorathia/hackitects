        <h2 style="padding-top: 30px;">&#8226 Infertility</h2>
        <p style="font-size: x-large; padding-top: 30px;">
            It can seem like hours pass while you wait for pregnancy test results. Women experience extreme desperation and disappointment when the outcome is bad. However, struggling to conceive a child has turned into a worldwide issue for many women. According
            to statistics, between 10 and 14 percent of Indians struggle with infertility, and rates are particularly high in metropolitan areas. For many couples, becoming parents may be a difficult journey, especially if they have tried for a long time
            to get pregnant without success. Over 27.5 million Indian couples who are attempting to get pregnant are now experiencing infertility. As couples persist in their efforts to conceive, here are few approaches they can adopt to facilitate the
            journey to parenthood. Our bodies are directly impacted by the stuff we eat. As a result, people wanting to conceive must follow a healthy eating plan because a poor diet might reduce the odds of conception. Put an emphasis on including healthy
            foods like leafy greens, fruit, whole grains, full-fat dairy, lean meats, and veggies in your regular meals. A diet high in whole foods, omega-3 fatty acids, iron, calcium, and other nutrients promotes egg production and enhances reproductive
            health in general.
        </p>

        <h2 style="padding-top: 30px;">&#8226 Effective Stress Management</h2>
        <p style="font-size: x-large; padding-top: 30px;">
            Dealing with infertility and the protracted process of trying to conceive may be extremely stressful, especially for women. However, failing to handle stress can interfere with the body's normal reproductive processes. Cortisol, a stress hormone, can
            impair communication between the brain and ovaries, resulting in unreliable menstrual periods. Consider adding yoga, breathing exercises, and stress-reduction strategies to treat this. Additionally, enlisting the assistance of a therapist
            or psychologist helps lessen its long-term effects.
        </p>

        <h2 style="padding-top: 30px;">&#8226 Follow the ovulation cycle</h2>
        <p style="font-size: x-large; padding-top: 30px;">
            Finding the peak fertility phase, which corresponds with ovulation, is essential to increasing the chance of conception. It's crucial to determine the exact moment of ovulation, which normally falls within a constrained 12â€“24 hour window. This stage often
            begins 12 to 14 days before the first menstrual cycle. People can efficiently track their cycle and have sexual activity during ovulation and the days before it by using a smartphone app or an ovulation monitoring kit. This strategy considerably
            raises the likelihood of successful fertilisation since sperm may remain viable for three to five days in the uterus when an egg is present.
        </p>

        <h2 style="padding-top: 30px;">&#8226 Maintaining an Appropriate Weight</h2>
        <p style="font-size: x-large; padding-top: 30px;">
            Numerous studies show that a woman's fertility is negatively impacted by both being underweight and being overweight. Keeping your BMI (Body Mass Index) within the healthy range of 20 to 24 is essential for boosting your chances of getting pregnant. Sadly,
            over 12 percent of women struggle because they are underweight, and over 25% of women develop ovulatory infertility as a result of obesity. Focus on keeping a healthy weight by consistent exercise, a well-balanced diet, and avoiding junk food
            to increase your chances of becoming pregnant.
        </p>

        <h2 style="padding-top: 30px;">&#8226 Gestational Diabetes</h2>
        <p style="font-size: x-large; padding-top: 30px;">
            High blood sugar levels are a feature of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), a kind of diabetes that appears during pregnancy. It happens when the body cannot utilise insulin efficiently or does not make enough of it. By allowing glucose to enter cells,
            where it may be utilised for energy, the hormone insulin helps to control blood sugar levels.
        </p>

        </p>

        <p style="font-size: x-large; padding-top: 10px;">
            Gestational diabetes poses risks for both the mother and the baby. For the mother, it increases the likelihood of developing type 2 diabetes later in life and can lead to pregnancy-related complications. For the baby, untreated gestational diabetes can
            cause excessive fetal growth, low blood sugar levels after birth, and an increased risk of type 2 diabetes and obesity later in life. Management includes lifestyle changes and medication treatments. Lifestyle modifications involve adopting
            a nutritious diet, regular exercise, and monitoring blood sugar levels. Medication or insulin treatment may be required to maintain ideal blood sugar levels. Regular prenatal care is crucial for prompt identification and effective management
            of gestational diabetes, ensuring favorable outcomes for both the mother and the baby. Postpartum screening and follow-up are essential due to the increased risk of type 2 diabetes in the future.
